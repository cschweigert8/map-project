# Udacity map-project

This project was written using specifications from Udacity's full stack developer course. This map-project application uses 3rd party APIs to display a Google map that is pre-populated with information about some of my favorite Arizona state parks.

This application uses Google Maps Developer API's to handle all map, marker, and place location functionality. The KnockOut framework is used to handle all initial data and state change of the places. Bootstrap is used to format the application and display items such as the sidebar and filter dropdown menu.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Maps project, fork the project from this Git Hub repository and save on your local computer. You will need to update the API key in the index.html file to use your personal API key.

```<script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&v=3&callback=initMap"></script>```

Once you have updated the API Key with your Google Developer API key, open index.html in your browser. If you need to request a Goolge developer API key, follow the instructions from Google [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
